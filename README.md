## Stripe Webhook microservice built with express

I built this because I couldn't find an open source one based on [Theo @ t3.gg](https://t3.gg)'s explanation on [how to stay sane implementing stripe](https://github.com/t3dotgg/stripe-recommendations).

It's a very redamentary implementation based on what I use for my 2 primary projects. Those being [TopStats.gg](https://topstats.gg) and [Some Random API](https://some-random-api.com)

## See something you don't like or something that needs refactoring?

Please submit contributions, I don't have the time or the experience to make everything **perfect** but I'd love to learn so if you contribute please make sure you give explanations of what I've done that needed improving so that I can actually gain more than just a `"this is bad, do it this way instead"` vibe.
